__doc__ = f""" Automatic serialized the necessary data

    In computing, serialization or serialisation is the process of translating
    a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored or
    transmitted and reconstructed later. When the resulting series of bits is
    reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a
    semantically identical clone of the original object. For many complex
    objects, such as those that make extensive use of references, this process
    is not straightforward. Serialization of object-oriented objects does not
    include any of their associated methods with which they were previously
    linked. This process of serializing an object is also called marshalling an
    object in some situations. The opposite operation, extracting a data
    structure from a series of bytes, is deserialization.

    This package works with all serialize systems. "Marshmallow" is used
    from the serialize packages by default. If need to write the special
    options or a new package will free to change the code this package
