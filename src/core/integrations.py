__doc__ = """ The integration package for integrate another APIs to easy.


    Application programming interface (API) is a software solution that
    connects all business systems to enhance production efficiency and
    communication. API integration is excellent for small businesses and large
    enterprises because it streamlines everyday procedures through system
    collaborations. This allows all applications to work as one, optimizing
    overall functionality.

    While implementing an API platform can increase overall business service
    speed and productivity, the solution's process and elements should first be
    considered. If developers attempt to integrate applications with
    contrasting infrastructures and protocols, additional time is required to
    adapt components.

    Therefore, management should research and consult with their IT department
    and software developers to determine what API models and functions will
    improve their operations.
