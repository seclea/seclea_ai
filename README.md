# Seclea: AI[dev]

> We started our journey as an EPSRC project, focusing on empowering users
> manage and control how organisations collect and consume their data. This
> project led us to the data consumed by Machine Learning and Deep Learning
> Algorithms with a clear question “how can such advanced algorithms explain
> their behaviour and decisions to ordinary users.” To answer the question,
> Seclea’s co-founders carried out a joint project that led to the formation of
> the Seclea.
>
> The work carried out at Smart Card Centre, Royal Holloway, University of
> London led us to the ICURe programme. The programme supported the refinement
> of Seclea’s features and how they can be deployed to overcome these AI trust
> and user empowerment challenges.
>
> Seclea is now supported by UKRI InnovateUK and RSE Enterprise Fellowship to
> bring its technology to market. Next chapter of our story is to change
> society to be fairer, more transparent and accountable through a diverse
> range of applications based on AI technologies.


A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a package up &
running.

```shell
./setup.py install
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration


## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:seclea/seclea_ai.git

cd seclea_ai/
./setup.py build_py
```

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this package to a
PyPi.org, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
./setup.py register
./setup.py test
./setup.py sdist
./setup.py sdist upload

```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this


## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
