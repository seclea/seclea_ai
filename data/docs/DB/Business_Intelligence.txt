What Does Business Intelligence (BI) Mean?
------------------------------------------
  Business intelligence (BI) is the use of computing technologies for the
  identification, discovery and analysis of business data - like sales revenue,
  products, costs and incomes.

  BI technologies provide current, historical and predictive views of
  internally structured data for products and departments by establishing more
  effective decision-making and strategic operational insights through
  functions like online analytical processing (OLAP), reporting, predictive
  analytics, data/text mining, benchmarking and Business Performance Management
  (BPM). These technologies and functions are often referred to as information
  management.



Techopedia Explains Business Intelligence (BI):
-----------------------------------------------
  Developed in the mid-1980s, modern BI evolved from 1960s-era decision support
  systems (DSS), which, with help of computer-aided models, assisted with
  planning and decision-making, leading to executive information systems (EIS),
  data warehouses (DW), OLAP and BI. BI did not achieve widespread acceptance
  until the late 1990s.

  BI software applications are used to gather data from data warehouses or data
  marts, which are separate yet linked BI architectural stack segments used for
  the preparation and use of data.

  BI is used for multiple business purposes, including:
  |
    * Measurement of performance and benchmarking progress toward business
      goals
  |
    * Quantitative analysis through predictive analytics, predictive modeling,
      business process modeling and statistical analysis
  |
    * Reporting of departmental/divisional and enterprise perspectives of data
      visualization, EISs and OLAP
  |
    * Collaborative programs that allow internal and external business
      entities to collaborate through electronic data interchange (EDI) and
      data sharing
  |
    * Use of knowledge management programs to identify and create insights and
      experiences for learning management and regulatory compliance

  BI also involves specific methodologies and procedures for implementing such
  interactive information gathering techniques, including:
  |
    * Identifying interview teams
    * Researching organizations
    * Selecting and preparing interviewees
    * Developing interview questions
    * Scheduling and sequencing interviews

  BI and its subset, competitive intelligence (CI), are considered synonymous.
  Like CI, BI is considered a decision support system (DSS). CI manages
  information focused on business competitors, whereas BI manages these
  functions (and more) by focusing on internal business products and
  departments.

  Studies by Merrill Lynch indicate that 85 percent of all business information
  is made up of unstructured or semi-structured data, including emails, news,
  reports, Web pages, presentations, phone conversation notes, image files,
  video files and marketing information. In the IT industry, management of such
  data is considered a major unsolved problem.
